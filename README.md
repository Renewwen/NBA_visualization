React JS based NBA Player Strength Visualization     
- Created a dashboard using React, D3, and Ant Design to visualize individual playerâ€™s shot data.
- Created 4 extra filters and 2 shot themes to provide more customized visualization on the shot chart.
- Optimized the user experience by adding an autocomplete player search bar providing a list of players (image and name) in the suggestion list, which will correct the typo and expedite at least 1s of searching speed.
